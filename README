PURPOSE:

I am using my GitHub account as a tool to practice using a collaborative
development environment and to practice coding using C/C++, Java, Python, and
others.  

I use comamnd line Git on my local computer and then remotely store my progress
at GitHub.

Hopefully, through this process, I will be able to learn new programming
languages and tools, while also using my previously learned skills.
For example, I am trying to get better with Python by writing programs using
Python and then, also writing using the other languages to produce Java and
C/C++ versions.  Thus, I force myself to remember them.
