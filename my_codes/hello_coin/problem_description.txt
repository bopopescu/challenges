A coin is tossed a finite number of times. Given the total number of flips, F, calculate the probability of getting at most H heads. Assume that the coin is fair (probability of heads and tails is equal).

INPUT FORMAT
The first line of the input will be, N, the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10
The subsequent N lines will be in the form:
F H

Where:
F = Total number of flips. 1 ≤ F ≤ 100
H = Upper bound on number of heads. 0 ≤ H ≤ F

OUTPUT FORMAT
The output must be the probability of getting at most H number of heads. 
All probabilities should be rounded to the nearest four decimal places.
